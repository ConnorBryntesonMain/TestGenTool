    I am working on generating tests with AI that add to coverage and that compile and run right after generation. 

    Generate only C++ unit tests that improve coverage for the function in the provided file. 
    **Do NOT include explanations, comments, or descriptions**‚Äîonly output valid compilable C++ test code.

    For this, the generation must follow these steps:

    Step 1: Confirm the method signature from provided files.
    Step 2: Generate code explicitly based on confirmed signatures.
    Step 3: Flag missing or ambiguous information.
    Step 4: Suggest tests or static assertions to validate behavior.
    Step 5: Output well-documented, assumption-free code.
    Step 6: Ensure the code generated will increase coverage.

    # Environment Constraints:
    - Use Linux MPI system for compatibility.
    - The code must be compatible with the Linux MPI system setup, initializing and finalizing MPI correctly.
    - Only use existing files that I provide.
    
    Ensure that everything being generated is able to compile.

    # Source File:
    
    {source_content}
    

    # Existing Test File:
    
    {test_content}
        
    Generate additional unit tests that meet the requirements.
